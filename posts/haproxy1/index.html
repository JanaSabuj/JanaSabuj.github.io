Thought of starting a blog to assimilate some ideas in a fun and interesting way. In this blogpost, I have talked about hands on loadbalancing with haproxy, coupled with go and docker compose.
In the modern world of distributed systems, it would be a sin to expose your applications without critical load balancing." />

  <p>Since I joined Flipkart, I have been been playing around with a lot of linux, networking, k8s, elb, go etc. Although hugely overwhelming at first sight, the learning is proving to be fun and interesting.</p>
<p>Thought of starting a blog to assimilate some ideas in a fun and interesting way. In this blogpost, I have talked about hands on loadbalancing with haproxy, coupled with go and docker compose.</p>
<p>In the modern world of distributed systems, it would be a sin to expose your applications without critical load balancing. We see what pitfalls your app can land into without loadbalancing, and then go on to setup a docker compose cluster locally to test our app with haproxy armoring it. And of course, memes included!</p>
<p>Read the blog <a href="https://medium.com/@SabujJanaCodes/hands-on-haproxy-loadbalancing-with-go-and-docker-compose-part-1-71ce6551f601">here</a> on <em>Medium</em>.</p>
<p>The blog gained a lot of traction and the in fact, the official <strong>HAProxy Technologies Twitter</strong> channel reposted this!</p>
<p>Find the embed tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/HAProxy/status/1629086419187638272?t=Rrd93iL6L-DeArQbJpwu9A&amp;s=19">here</a> on <em>Twitter</em>.</p>
