      <description>ðŸ“– Read the full blog here: https://medium.com/@SabujJanaCodes/running-a-full-stack-app-in-istio-service-mesh-part-1-87b828f4d1cc
ðŸ—„ Most workloads today are running on Kubernetes. But is only Kubernetes enough for companies? To solve the problems of Networking, Observability, Security, Traffic Control - the world is moving towards ServiceMesh - with Istio being the open source leading service mesh.
Istio enables organizations to secure, connect, and monitor microservices, so they can modernize their enterprise apps more swiftly and securely.
ðŸŽ¯ In this blog, we setup a full stack app in Istio and deploy Istio objects like Gateway, VirtualService, Istio IngressGateway etc.</description>

      <title>Building a Kubernetes Operator in GO: Reconciling our PdfDoc CRD for Converting Text to PDF files</title>

      <description>In this blog, we write a Kubernetes operator in Golang, using Kubebuilder framework for the initial scaffolding. Writing a k8s operator lets us react to events in the cluster and reconcile the cluster state in response to such triggers.
We create our custom CRD (named PdfDoc) and configure the k8s operator to respond to the CRD creation events. This blog will will serve as the foundation for writing more advanced controllers in Go for Kubernetes tooling.</description>

      <title>Shared Volume in Kubernetes Pod: A fun experiment</title>

      <description>We all know that each container in a Kubernetes Pod gets its own filesystem. Also Pods are ephemeral i.e, they get restarted frequently. This means that any data that was written by the pod into its own filesystem will be lost once the container restarts, and the new container (even though in the same pod) will not see the data written by the previous container.
Performed a small fun experiment to demonstrate the concept of shared volumes between the containers in the same Kubernetes Pod.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes Club Ep 01: Decrypting a K8s Cluster Hands On</title>

      <description>Starting a blog series named Kubernetes Club (Inspired by the movie Fight Club).
Here I will be talking about all things k8s, Istio and their related cloud-native technologies. The episodes will be hands-on and full of diagrams so that people can follow alongside and get a feel of k8s. Also, I included memes - figured it would be a win-win.
Since joining Flipkart, I have been exposed to the wonderful of Kubernetes and Istio.</description>
