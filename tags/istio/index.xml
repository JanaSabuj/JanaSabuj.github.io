      <description>Recently, I have been working a lot with Istio Service Mesh in Flipkart.Now that Istio Ambient Mesh has been released, it was high time that I do my bit of self-exploration of the same, before moving ahead with it in Production. The long weekend seemed perfect for this :)
In this blog, we setup our home kubernetes cluster and start exploring the Istio ambient mesh. The focal point of this new dataplane mode is that it is a sidecar-less model and hence the fat cash savings we have against compute power and cloud bills.</description>
