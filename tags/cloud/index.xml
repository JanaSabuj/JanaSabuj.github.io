      <title>Touring the Kubernetes Istio Ambient Mesh â€” Part 1: Setup, ZTunnel</title>

      <description>Recently, I have been working a lot with Istio Service Mesh in Flipkart.Now that Istio Ambient Mesh has been released, it was high time that I do my bit of self-exploration of the same, before moving ahead with it in Production. The long weekend seemed perfect for this :)
In this blog, we setup our home kubernetes cluster and start exploring the Istio ambient mesh. The focal point of this new dataplane mode is that it is a sidecar-less model and hence the fat cash savings we have against compute power and cloud bills.</description>

      <description>It has been few months that I have been working with GCP products and offerings. Recently, I recieved a company-sponsored opportunity to avail the GCP Professional Cloud Developer certification.
Certfication I went for : https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-developer

      <description>ðŸ“– Read the full blog here: https://medium.com/@SabujJanaCodes/running-a-full-stack-app-in-istio-service-mesh-part-1-87b828f4d1cc
ðŸ—„ Most workloads today are running on Kubernetes. But is only Kubernetes enough for companies? To solve the problems of Networking, Observability, Security, Traffic Control - the world is moving towards ServiceMesh - with Istio being the open source leading service mesh.
Istio enables organizations to secure, connect, and monitor microservices, so they can modernize their enterprise apps more swiftly and securely.
ðŸŽ¯ In this blog, we setup a full stack app in Istio and deploy Istio objects like Gateway, VirtualService, Istio IngressGateway etc.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Go concurrency: Building a public File Download Manager</title>
      <link>https://janasabuj.github.io/posts/concurrent-file-downloader/</link>

      <description>In this blog, we leverage the power of Golang&amp;rsquo;s concurrency constructs to write a concurrent file downloader.
We discuss the pros and cons of downloading a file synchronously vs chunking the file up into smaller parts and downloading them asynchronously. Subsequently, we go ahead and write the entire appliacation in Go.
We fire &amp;lsquo;chunk&amp;rsquo; no of goroutines in parallel to concurrently donwload each file chunk. Thereafter, we merge the temporary downloaded files and build the final downloaded file.</description>

      <title>HELM-ing our Kubernetes deployed Golang music api</title>
      <link>https://janasabuj.github.io/posts/musicapik8s-helm/</link>

      <description>In the previous blog, we built a golang music api and deployed it on top of K8s. However, the manifest files for our app (api and mysql components) were huge in number. This will make our app distribution infeasible since end users will need to manually apply all the manifest yamls in their k8s cluster.
In comes the saviour - Helm charts. Apt is to Debian as Helm is to Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>We love building backend applications. But have we ever thought of building it cloud-natively? Did we ever keep in mind the deployment process and the underlying infra that would eventually be running our app ?
In this blog, we build a golang backend music rest api and deploy it on Kubernetes. We use a lot of k8s constructs like Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumeClaims, PersistentVolumes, port-forwarding etc - all in one - for deploying our backend app.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes Club Ep 01: Decrypting a K8s Cluster Hands On</title>

      <description>Starting a blog series named Kubernetes Club (Inspired by the movie Fight Club).
Here I will be talking about all things k8s, Istio and their related cloud-native technologies. The episodes will be hands-on and full of diagrams so that people can follow alongside and get a feel of k8s. Also, I included memes - figured it would be a win-win.
Since joining Flipkart, I have been exposed to the wonderful of Kubernetes and Istio.</description>

      <title>Hands on Haproxy LoadBalancing [with Go and Docker Compose]â€” Part 1</title>
      <link>https://janasabuj.github.io/posts/haproxy1/</link>

      <description>Since I joined Flipkart, I have been been playing around with a lot of linux, networking, k8s, elb, go etc. Although hugely overwhelming at first sight, the learning is proving to be fun and interesting.
Thought of starting a blog to assimilate some ideas in a fun and interesting way. In this blogpost, I have talked about hands on loadbalancing with haproxy, coupled with go and docker compose.
In the modern world of distributed systems, it would be a sin to expose your applications without critical load balancing.</description>
