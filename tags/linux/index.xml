      <title>Shared Volume in Kubernetes Pod: A fun experiment</title>

      <description>We all know that each container in a Kubernetes Pod gets its own filesystem. Also Pods are ephemeral i.e, they get restarted frequently. This means that any data that was written by the pod into its own filesystem will be lost once the container restarts, and the new container (even though in the same pod) will not see the data written by the previous container.
Performed a small fun experiment to demonstrate the concept of shared volumes between the containers in the same Kubernetes Pod.</description>

      <description>I created a program called VirtualCF — A Codeforces parser for a specific contest identified by Id. It can be used for uninterrupted and smooth participation in a virtual contest, upsolving a practice contest or even a live contest.

The relevant code can be found here on Github.
I created a Youtube Video for the code walkthrough here.</description>

      <description>I wrote an useful python script- ParseCF
It will parse all the Codeforces contests that a particular user has participated in till date, make separate folders for every contest and every folder would contain all the user’s submissions for that particular contest , ordered by the problem names.
